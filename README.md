# Triptych "Red"
Offset Print / Augmented Reality / CryptoArt


Concept description
===================

In 1676, Sir Isaac Newton, decomposed white sunlight into a color spectrum, using a triangular prism. The spectrum contained all colors. Each color of the spectrum is characterised by its wavelength. This experiment by Newton completely changed the human perception of color.

Red color: wavelength 800-650 nm., frequency 400-470 trillion.

Nowadays, technologies are deeply integrated into the modern world. It completely changes how we interact and communicate. In the future, everything will be digitized. Physical objects will no longer have value without a digital copy. In this project, the author tries to achieve interaction between a physical object, a viewer, and a digital space. The boundaries of penetration of the digital world into the real world are difficult to assess, they can only be felt. Each work symoolizes a kind of prism that transforms a physical object into a digital space.

The value of the work
=====================

Determining the value of a work of art is a cornerstone that confuses millions of minds. The author proposes to transfer methods of assessing popularity and significance from the digital world to the physical one. Each work contains a QR code by clicking on which the viewer is transferred to the digital realisation of the picture. The number of clicks directly affects the cost of work. The physical copy price is generated dynamically based on conversion statistics.

Implementation
==============

The project was implemented as a part of [Denis Vorobyov's](https://www.facebook.com/denysvorobiov) "author's course "Contemporary Art and New Media" at the [School of visual communication](https://svc.com.ua/) (Kyiv, Ukraine). The work is on exposition for 3 weeks at the school. At the end of the exhibition, this work can be purchased from the author.

CryptoArt
=========

This work will be incomplete if it remains only in the form of a physical copy. Today there is a whole trend in art that has completely shifted to the digital format already. CryptoArt is a movement where art is created, displayed, and sold digitally. Collectors buy digital tokens (a unique key certified on the Ethereum blockchain) instead of paintings.\
To connect physical space with digital, the author converted the original into a digital token. [This work can be purchased as digital art](https://app.rarible.com/timurproko?tab=collectibles) through the CryptoArt movement. This once again confirms that the value of contemporary art is determined by the concept and not the physical object.

Contemporary art is doomed without digital implementation.
